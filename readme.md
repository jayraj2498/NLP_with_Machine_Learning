# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Operations for Machine Learning README

## Introduction
Natural Language Processing (NLP) involves the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. In machine learning, NLP techniques are widely used for tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and named entity recognition. This README provides an overview of common NLP operations for machine learning tasks.

## Tokenization
Tokenization is the process of splitting text into smaller units, such as words or subwords, known as tokens. It is a fundamental step in NLP tasks as it breaks down text into meaningful components for further analysis.

## Text Preprocessing
Text preprocessing involves cleaning and formatting raw text data to improve the quality and consistency of input for NLP tasks. Common preprocessing steps include lowercasing, removing punctuation, stop words, and stemming or lemmatization.

## Feature Extraction
Feature extraction involves transforming raw text data into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms. Techniques such as bag-of-words, TF-IDF, and n-grams are commonly used to extract features from text.

## Word Embeddings
Word embeddings are dense vector representations of words in a high-dimensional space, learned from large corpora of text. They capture semantic relationships between words and are essential for many NLP tasks, such as word similarity and analogy detection.

## Text Vectorization
Text vectorization is the process of converting text data into numerical vectors. It encompasses both feature extraction techniques and word embeddings, enabling the representation of text in a format suitable for machine learning models.



## Conclusion
Natural Language Processing (NLP) operations are essential for many machine learning tasks involving text data. Understanding and applying these operations enable the development of robust and efficient NLP systems for a wide range of applications.
